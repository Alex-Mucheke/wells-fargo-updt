# TODO List for Repositioning Credit Card Icon

## Detailed Steps from Plan:

### Information Gathered:
- Fixed structure in `.options-grid`: Credit cards item will have label above icon (💳); Loans item extracted as separate with icon above label.
- No other file dependencies.

### Plan Execution Steps:
- [x] Step 1: Edit `wells-fargo-main/index.html` - Restructure the third `.option-item` for Credit cards: Place `<span class="option-label">Credit cards</span>` first, then add `<div class="option-icon credit-card">` with 💳 icon below it. Fix the nested fourth item by making Loans a proper separate `.option-item` with its 🏘️ icon above the label.
- [x] Step 2: Verify changes - Launch browser preview of `wells-fargo-main/index.html` to confirm four balanced grid items, Credit cards label above icon, no layout breaks.
- [x] Step 3: Update this TODO.md - Mark Step 1 and Step 2 complete, then close the overall task.

### Dependent Files:
- None beyond `index.html`.

### Followup:
- No installations needed. Task complete - TODO closed.
